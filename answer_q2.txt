In resize_spectrogram, we perform resize using spectrogram scaling, resizing small windows of the sound, one at each
time. The problem is, that in order to avoid unnatural discontinuities between the
segments, we choose overlapping windows.
In the overlap parts, we could encounter offset, which can cause waves to cancel each other. phase adjustment
is needed to avoid it, which we perform only in the vocoder, that why it sound better.
